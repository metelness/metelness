### Hi there, I'm Adam Curry! ðŸ‘‹

#### About Me
Iâ€™m passionate about using data to uncover stories that drive smarter decisions and stronger strategies. With over 15 years in the financial industry, I specialize in fraud analytics, risk management, and data-driven innovation at Wells Fargo. Iâ€™ve spearheaded strategies that uncovered 20+ fraudulent accounts, cut conflicts of interest by 90%, and managed 30+ analytics projects, all while leading a team of 10 analysts to embed data science and communication best practices.

My toolkit includes SQL, Python, SAS, Tableau, and emerging tech like AI with Copilotâ€”Iâ€™ve leveraged these to build detection systems, streamline operations (slashing reporting effort by 90%), and boost fraud detection accuracy by 13%. I thrive on transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, collaborating with cross-functional teams to align with business goals, and mentoring others to unlock their potential.

Outside of data, Iâ€™m deeply committed to community and youth development, coaching softball, baseball, and basketball. I find mentoring in sports mirrors mentoring in data scienceâ€”both demand teamwork, growth, and a love for learning.

Letâ€™s connect to explore how we can collaborate on fraud mitigation, data strategies, or shared passions. Iâ€™m always up for a conversation about shaping the future of analytics!
